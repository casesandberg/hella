## Demo
http://chopshopapp.com/#

_Provides 'Wrecking Ball','Somebody I used to Know', 'Californication' and **more**_

##Description
Chopshop allows users to mix 'm match multiple songs. Uses the [Echo Nest API](http://infinitejuke.com/ "Example of Echo Nest API") to isloate bars and beat signatures from MP3s, and play them once rearranged. 

##Next Step?
###1. Clean up the Shop 
Solve problems with clearing, playing and stopping the playhead. Solve problem that occurs when moving bars from track player. Only initialize 2 songs for remixing to make the page load _way_ faster.

###2. SoundWaves
Create soundwave images from extracted music signatures, and overlay them on their respective music sequences.

###3. Add Even Smaller Signatures
Go beyond bars and provide beats suquences(as described in the Echo Nest API.)

###4. Playhead scrubbing
Make the playhead movable, so that users can scrub to certain parts in the remix.

###5. Upload MP3s and Download Remixes
Echo Nest graciously provides uploading and downloading capabilities. Utilize them to provide a way to download remixes.
